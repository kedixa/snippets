# hello-world-for-theano
small tests when I learning theano.

When I start to learn Machine Learning using [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano), I have encountered great difficulties. I may not update these code, because they are really simple, even ridiculous, but the confusion I meet today may help you in some ways when you meet the same situation with me.
